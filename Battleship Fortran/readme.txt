This text-based battleship game was created as a final project for our class under AMAT150 (Computer Programming).

Main Developer: Adrian Amiel P. Sanchez

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Each player first sets up there ships in their respective 'Ship Board'. 
2. The coordinates for each ship should be given. Coordinates must be written with a format of 'LetterNumber' (i.e. A2, a3, c4, etc.). Also, each succeeding coordinates should be entered in such a way that they are next to each other. The ship can only be placed horizontally or vertically. 
3. After each player placed their ships, they would now take turn in putting in coordinates to try and hit an opponents ship. After doing a move, the program would indicate if the turn is a 'Miss' or a 'Hit'
4. A player wins if he/she destroyed all of the opposing players ship.
